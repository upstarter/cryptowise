<h4>
  The tide of centralization/decentralization has once again shifted towards
  the decentralization as edge and fog computing are set to overtake cloud
  computing.
</h4>
<p>In the early days of computing, centralized
  mainframes owned and operated by centralized organizations ruled the information
  world. Then the personal computer revolution and client/server arose to
  decentralize power. The cloud brought a whole new level of centralization as
  once again big tech and big data took control of our personal data in giant cloud
  silos to extract every ounce of profit from the precious data which reveals
  insights into human psychology and allows mass and individual manipulation
  for the purposes of profits and shareholder value.
</p>
<p>
  Adding additional layers of waste to the human condition, our social
  institutions are being run on antiquated governance structures. Long gone are
  the feudal days where hierarchies of centralized power are necessary to
  maintain order. The enlightenment brought the human mind a well organized
  sense of personal responsibility and freedom. Since the declaration of
  independence and the proliferation of the corporation, the problem has usually
  been over-organization and too much order and control. The creative human
  spirit is being crushed by the overwhelming weight of bureaucratic
  hierarchical command & control. Freedom is restricted and constrained by the
  well-meaning but misguided authority of a select few figures who are tied into
  the aristocratic network at the top wealth centers of society. The top 1% own
  99% of the wealth and control the masses from centralized vantage points which
  drains the people of their power to create value.
</p>
<p>
  Thankfully, the current cycle of decentralization holds great
  promise in bringing a new level of power to the masses.
  The legal entities of the next 5-10 years will be light-years beyond
  todays status quo in organization and function. Where most popular
  technological trends follow ever-shortening cycles of marketing
  hype, peer-to-peer decentralized networking and efficient
  distributed computation are very solid long term trends worth
  following.

  The information networks of our time reside within the realms of
  Quantum Computing, Crypto Networking, Artificial Intelligence,
  Cloud/Fog/Edge computing, IoT, Robotics, BioTech, CRISPR,
  NanoTech, TransformativeTech, HealthTech, Mixed Reality, RegTech,
  GovTech.

  Cryptoassets represent the native asset class of information
  networks: setting up a means of both capitalization and
  monetization. As information networks grow and mature, so will our
  understanding of the archetypal tokens in the crypto ecosystem.
